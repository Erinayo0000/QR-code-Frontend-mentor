## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

i learnt that mobile view of any project i work on should be designed first  before the desktop and tablet view. i had no knowledge about it before but with this challenge,i have learnt alot 


### Continued development
i wish to focus more on css grid, flexbox and media query.

### Useful resources
w3school.com -this helped me alot while i was contemplating on media query and how to use github
